This is a simple app using the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) for people who want to serach for your favorite books that you love, or simply just want to save it to buy/read later.

## Getting Started

I used the following libraries/frameworks to build this App:

1. [React](https://reactjs.org/)
2. [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
3. [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
4. [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books)
5. [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

And the following fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) :

1. [Roboto](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300&display=swap)
2. [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Josefin+Sans&family=Roboto:wght@300&display=swap)

The Google Books API is pretty straightforward, Google has a pretty good documentation and tutorial for that, so don´t worry.

Styled components is very simple to use too, you just have to install it first:

        yarn add styled-components | npx install styled-components

They have a very good documentation as well.

## Fonts

For the fonts, it just needs a basic instruction, after you found which fonts do you want, you add it to your "cart", and from there, you´ĺl get a specific link tag that you´ll insert inside your HTML head tag, and voila! You´re all set to start using it as a font-family attribute value.

## Steps

We have the home page, as you should see at the start of the ReadMe. From there you can simply type the book title, author, or even the publisher, and hit the search button. You´ll be sent to the 'Search Page'

### Search Page

Here you´ll get the results from the input that you typed.

If you want to, after you click on one the the book cards, you´ll be sent to the description page, from where you can decide if you want to add this book to your favorites list, or just go back and keep searching.

### Description page

In this page, you´ll have a better look at the book, and its description. You caa add the chosen book to your favorites list.

## Favorites Page

![Favorites Page](https://i.postimg.cc/FzX0S1FK/Favorites-Page.png)

Inside this page, you´ll have all the books that you previously added to your favorites. You can use this page to keep track of the books you love the most, or simply to organize a set of books that you´d like to read/buy it later!
